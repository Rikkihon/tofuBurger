# tofuBurger

This is a game where you make a list of the different types of tofu burgers you want to eat. Then you click the devoured button and move it over to the consumed column. 

This project is based on mySQL in the backend database, using Sequlite, Nodejs (8.1.1), Express and Javascript & jQuery. 

To run, clone this repo into your desktop.
Open mySql and have the database connected. 

The start script is "node server.js" to get the server started. 
By default, this will run on port 3000 locally.
